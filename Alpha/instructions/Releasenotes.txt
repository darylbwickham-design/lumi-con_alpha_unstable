# Release Notes — Lumi-Con Integrated Plugin (v1 → v5.1)

Short, user-facing notes you can paste into GitHub Releases, README highlights, or YouTube descriptions.

---

## v5.1 — Optional Debug Toasts (Latest)
- Added **optional debug toasts** inside Lumia (default OFF).
- Toast modes:
  - **Important**: toasts only on **Connected** and **Offline**
  - **Verbose**: toasts on **Connected/Offline** + **every key event** + **every TFT action**
- Includes basic **rate limiting** so it won’t spam too hard.

Best for: troubleshooting, builder support, quick verification during setup.

---

## v5.0 — Device Status + Offline Detection
- Added **offline detection** (no events for ~30s → device marked offline).
- Added `device_status_text` variable (single-line “device health” string).
- Keeps device status variables up-to-date automatically.

Best for: “professional feel” + easy overlays (“connected/offline”) + support.

---

## v4.0 — Separate Key Label Pages (Short vs Long)
- Added **two independent key label maps**:
  - **Key labels (Short 0–35)**
  - **Key labels (Long 0–35)**
- `key_label` automatically matches the press type (short/long).

Best for: real stream-deck behavior (two layers) without confusion.

---

## v3.0 — Onboarding + Key Labels + Device Vars
- Improved **out-of-box experience** (sane defaults, minimal required setup).
- Added **key labels (0–35)** mapping and `key_label` variable.
- Added baseline **device status variables** (id, last seen, rssi, connected, etc.).

Best for: users who want a cleaner “product” experience.

---

## v2.0 — Confirmed Delivery (Seq ACK + /health + Dedupe)
- Added `GET /health` endpoint on the plugin listener.
- Added **seq ACK** response for `/event` so “confirmed mode” works reliably.
- Added **dedupe** using `(deviceId, seq)` to prevent double triggers during retries.

Best for: reliability and “appliance grade” behavior.

---

## v1.0 — First Integrated Release
- Combined **matrix event listener** + **TFT display actions** into one plugin.
- Two alerts (Short + Long) with **36 variations each**.
- Display actions for TFT:
  - Display Message, Status Message, Clear Screen
- Supports both display modes:
  - **Legacy GET** (`/msg`, `/status`, `/clear`)
  - **UI POST** (`/ui` JSON)

Best for: getting the full stack working quickly.
